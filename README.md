## 🧩 D2R-D2 — Runewords from Diablo II: Resurrected and Ladder-only runewords in Classic Diablo II (1.14d) single player

## ⚔️ Overview

D2R-D2 is a lightweight mod that ports most Diablo II: Resurrected (v2.6) runewords into Diablo II: Lord of Destruction (1.14d).
It allows single-player users to enjoy the newer runewords without needing D2R or Battle.net.

This project modifies the game’s .txt data files and uses the built-in -direct -txt launch method.
No executable or binary patches — completely safe and easy to remove.

## 🛠️ Installation

Copy the "data" folder to your Diablo II installation directory.

Example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\data


Edit your Diablo II shortcut to include the following at the end of the Target line:

-direct -txt


Example full line:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\Game.exe" -direct -txt


Launch the game normally — the new runewords will now be available.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The mod includes updated .txt files (Runes.txt) extracted from D2R and adapted for compatibility with LoD’s 1.14d engine.
By launching Diablo II with the -direct -txt flags, the game loads that data file directly instead of those packed inside the MPQ archives.

No game binaries are altered — the mod is safe, reversible, and EULA-friendly for offline play.


## ⚠️ Known Issues

Some newer D2R stats are not recognized by LoD.

This mod is not intended for online environments (Battle.net) — single-player only.
